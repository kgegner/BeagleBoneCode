'''VOLTTRON platformâ„¢ example service for user interaction.
Opens a listening socket on 127.0.0.1:7575 to interact with the user by
displaying the current state and asking for a new one. When the new
state is entered, the new state is printed and the next state is
requested.  State transitions are sent to the VOLTTRON message bus on
the topic 'askbot/state' as a two-tuple (previous_state, current_state).
The listening address, backlog count, and initial state can be
configured through the agent configuration file.
Many security and error checks are omitted for clarity. Please do not
use this agent without validating all connections and inputs.
Connect to the agent using one of the following commands:
    nc 127.0.0.1 7575
    netcat 127.0.0.1 7575
    socat - TCP-CONNECT:127.0.0.1:7575
    telnet 127.0.0.1 7575
